Hello, friend.

tl;dr you're probably looking for the official [Tari protocol source code repo](https://github.com/tari-project/tari).

# The Tari protocol
Tari is an open source, digital assets focused blockchain protocol that is being architected as a merge-mined sidechain with Monero. 

We are focusing specifically on digital assets – things like tickets, loyalty points, in-game items, and crypto-native assets like CryptoKitties – because we see a huge opportunity to revolutionize the way these assets are owned, managed and transferred.

Tari is a 100% community-driven [open source project](https://github.com/tari-project/tari).

# Tari Labs

Tari Labs is a small company based in Johannesburg and Oakland that is acting as the steward for the Tari protocol development. If you're interested in joining the team, have a look at our [open positions](https://www.tari.com/contribute/).

We're also building and curating an amazing set of resources for helping developers get up to speed on blockchain and Rust development. Keep an eye on [TariLabs University](https://github.com/tari-labs/tari-university) -- we add new talks and reports on a weekly basis.
